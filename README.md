### Windows
Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can typically use the Download Python button that appears first on the page to download the latest version.

Note: If you don't have admin access, an additional option for installing Python on Windows is to use the Microsoft Store. The Microsoft Store provides installs of Python 3.7, Python 3.8, Python 3.9, and Python 3.10. Be aware that you might have compatibility issues with some packages using this method.

For additional information about using Python on Windows, see Using Python on Windows at Python.org

### macOS
The system install of Python on macOS is not supported. Instead, an installation through Homebrew is recommended. To install Python using Homebrew on macOS use brew install python3 at the Terminal prompt.

Note On macOS, make sure the location of your VS Code installation is included in your PATH environment variable. See these setup instructions for more information.

### Linux
The built-in Python 3 installation on Linux works well, but to install other Python packages you must install pip with get-pip.py.
